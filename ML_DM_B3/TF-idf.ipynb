      "            Ghost Shark and Manta Ray protect the undersea realm. Sounds like the plot of a future Marvel movie, but in actual fact, it’s what could be the future of Pacific naval defenses.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Ghost Shark and Manta Ray are the names of prototype uncrewed underwater vehicles – UUVs or drones – introduced recently by Australia and the United States respectively.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Experts say the submersibles could represent the future of undersea warfare, showing the ability to exert power while minimizing the danger to human life.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The use of drones in aerial warfare has become commonplace. The US used them extensively during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan beginning in the 1990s, and newer, cheaper drones have become key pieces of military hardware for both sides in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Kyiv has also built naval surface drones, which have inflicted heavy losses on the much larger and more expensive ships of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Aerial and surface sea drones can be controlled using satellites and light and radio waves. But those don’t function in the same way in the depths.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A 2023 study published in the Swiss journal Sensors points out that underwater communications require more energy but still see significant data loss to variables including water temperature, salinity and depth.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Makers of the new generation of military UUVs aren’t saying how they would overcome communications problems.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But when Australia unveiled Ghost Shark last month, it called the prototypes “the most advanced undersea autonomous vehicles in the world.”\n",
      "     \n",
      "            “Ghost Shark will provide Navy with a stealthy, long-range autonomous undersea warfare capability that can conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and strike,” a statement from the Australian Defense Ministry said, adding that it expects the first production models to be delivered by the end of next year.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Australian officials and those from manufacturer Anduril Australia said they could not share any of the specs on Ghost Shark as those remain classified.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But they touted the speed with which the submersible has gone from idea to testing, with the program having started just two years ago.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            “Being ahead of schedule, on budget, it’s pretty unheard of,” Shane Arnott, Anduril’s senior vice president for engineering, told reporters.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            “Delivering the first Ghost Shark prototype ahead of schedule sets a new standard for capability development at the speed of need,” Australia’s chief defense scientist, Tanya Monro, said in a statement.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Emma Salisbury, a fellow at the British think tank Council on Geostrategy, said the Ghost Shark seems much like the Orca extra-large UUV being developed in the US.\n",
      "     \n",
      "Related article\n",
      "A Ukrainian pilot outlines how drones powered by jet skis sunk a Russian warship\n",
      " \n",
      "            “I assume that they are all intended for roughly similar mission sets – persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike capability, particularly in the anti-submarine domain,” Salisbury said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The US Navy called the Boeing-built Orca UUV “a cutting-edge, autonomous, unmanned diesel-electric submarine with a modular payload section to execute a variety of missions” in a December news release on the delivery of a first Orca test platform, an early prototype.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Having a modular payload means the Orca in theory could carry different weapons varieties depending upon the task or be fitted with specialized equipment for reconnaissance or possibly intelligence gathering.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The release said the Pentagon would acquire five more of the UUVs, without giving a timetable. But the US Orca has been in the works for more than a decade, the Navy release said, a sharp contrast to the speed with which Australia has developed Ghost Shark.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Chris Brose, Anduril’s chief strategy officer, said the company and Australia are in the “process of proving” that “these kinds of capabilities can be built much faster, much cheaper, much more intelligently.”\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Anduril Australia said the entirely domestically developed Ghost Shark would be made available for export after it joins the Australian naval fleet.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Meanwhile, back across the Pacific, the Orca isn’t the only UUV being developed in the US.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            America’s latest UUV entry is Northrop Grumman’s Manta Ray, a prototype of which was tested off Southern California in February and March.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon branch in charge of developing new technologies, says Manta Ray’s strength is in its modularity, the ability to switch out payloads depending on the mission.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            It can be broken down and fit into five standard shipping containers, move to where it’s going to be deployed, and reassembled in the field, according to Northrop Grumman.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The prototype was built in Maryland and then reassembled on the California coast.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            “The combination of cross-country modular transportation, in-field assembly, and subsequent deployment demonstrates a first-of-kind capability for an extra-large UUV,” Kyle Woerner, who heads the Manta Ray program at DARPA, said in an agency news release.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            He also noted the modular transport method means the Manta Ray can save internal energy for its mission, rather than using it to get to the deployment site.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Like the Orca, the Manta Ray hasn’t come together as quickly as Ghost Shark. Its program began in 2020 and DARPA didn’t give a goal for the Manta Ray – or some variant of it – to join the US fleet.\n",

      "     \n",
      "            Meanwhile, China, named by the US military as its “pacing threat” in the Pacific, is also making advances in UUVs, Salisbury said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            “While details are scarce, as with most Chinese capabilities, they have been developing them for at least 15 years and likely now have something similar to the Orca (but with torpedoes) in the testing phase,” she said.\n",

      "            Besides Australia, the US and China, other countries working on UUVs include Canada, France, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Norway, Russia, South Korea, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, according to Sutton.\n",

      "Russian officials say they shot down 144 Ukrainian drones around the country overnight in a wave of attacks that have killed one woman, set residential buildings on fire and grounded flights in Moscow. The governor of Moscow, Andrei Vorobyov, said several flats in two high-rise apartment buildings in Ramenskoye in Moscow region were set on fire. Mr Vorobyov said a 46-year-old woman died and three people were injured in Ramenskoye, while 43 people were evacuated to temporary accommodation centres. Ukraine has so far not commented on the attacks, but the Kremlin on Tuesday said the attack showed Ukraine was Russia's enemy. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a daily call with reporters that the strike showed the need for Russia to continue its war in Ukraine, saying: \"We must continue the military operation in order to protect ourselves from such displays of this regime.\" Russia's defence ministry said earlier that of the 144 drones that its air defences intercepted, half were in the western border region of Bryansk, 20 were in Moscow and 14 were over the Kursk region. State media reported that the strikes shut down four airports in Moscow and more than 30 domestic and international flights that serve the Russian capital were suspended. Russia's aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, confirmed on Telegram on Tuesday morning that three of the airports -  Domodedovo, Zhukovsky and Vnukovo - had resumed operations. In other developments on Tuesday, Russia said it had captured at least three villages in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The defence ministry also said it had \"liberated\" the town of Krasnohorivka, also in Donetsk. Separately, the Ukrainian Air Force said on Telegram that its air defences downed 38 out of 46 Shahed-type attack drones launched by Russia. They were shot down over a number of regions and cities including Kyiv, Odesa, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltova. The air force added that Russia also launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile and a Kh-31 air-to-surface missile. Ukraine and Russia regularly launch overnight drone raids on each other's territory. The latest wave of drone strikes comes as Moscow claims gains in eastern Ukraine. In the last two days, Moscow said its forces had captured Memryk and Novohrodivka - two villages that are 24km and 10km from the key town of Pokrovsk.  Kyiv has not commented, but sources told the BBC that Ukrainian forces had retreated from Novohrodivka. So far this month, Russia has launched a wave of deadly strikes on Lviv, Poltava and Kharkiv. Russia's response to Ukraine has hardened after Kyiv launched its offensive into the country's Kursk region last month. Both have both felt the shadow of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and both are former Soviet republics. Dawn Sturgess was inadvertently exposed to the deadly nerve agent Novichok in Amesbury in 2018.

      "Western technology and finance are helping Ukraine carry out hundreds of long-range strikes inside Russia. That is despite Nato allies still refusing to give Ukraine permission to use Western-supplied munitions to do so – mostly because of fears of escalation. Ukraine has been stepping up its long-range strikes inside Russia over the past few months, launching scores of drones simultaneously at strategic targets several times a week.  The targets include air force bases, oil and ammunition depots and command centres. Ukrainian firms are now producing hundreds of armed one-way attack drones a month, at a fraction of the cost it takes to produce a similar drone in the West.  One company told the BBC it was already creating a disproportionate impact on Russia’s war economy at a relatively small expense. The BBC has been briefed by a number of those involved in these missions. They include one of Ukraine’s largest one-way attack drone manufacturers, as well as a big data company which has helped develop software for Ukraine to carry out these strikes. Francisco Serra-Martins says the strategy is already creating huge dilemmas for Moscow. He believes that with extra investment, it will turn the tide of the war in Ukraine’s favour. Eighteen months ago, the company he co-founded, Terminal Autonomy, didn’t even exist. It is now producing more than a hundred AQ400 Scythe long-range drones a month, with a range of 750km (465 miles). The company also makes hundreds of  shorter range AQ100 Bayonet drones a month, which can fly a few hundred kilometres. The drones are made of wood and are being assembled in former furniture factories in Ukraine. Mr Serra-Martins, a former Australian Army Royal Engineer, set up the company with his Ukrainian co-founder, backed by US finance. It is one of at least three companies now producing drones in Ukraine at scale. He describes his drones as “basically flying furniture – we assemble it like Ikea”. It takes about an hour to build the fuselage and half that time to put the brains inside it – the electronics, motor and explosives. The company’s Bayonet drone costs a few thousand dollars. In contrast, a Russian air defence missile used to shoot it down can cost more than $1m.      It is not only cheap drones making the difference.  Palantir, a large US data analysis company,  was one of the first Western tech companies to aid Ukraine’s war effort. It started by providing software to improve the speed and accuracy of its artillery strikes. Now it has given Ukraine new tools  to plan its long-range drone strikes. British engineers from Palantir, working with Ukrainian counterparts, have designed a programme to generate and map the best ways to reach a target. Palantir makes clear it is not involved in the missions, but has helped train more than 1,000 Ukrainians how to use its software. The BBC has been shown how it works in principle. Using streams of data, it can map Russia’s air defences, radar and electronic jammers. The end product looks similar to a topographical chart. The tighter the contours, the heavier the air defences. The locations have already  been identified by Ukraine using commercial satellite imagery and signals intelligence. Louis Mosley of Palantir says the programme is helping Ukraine to skirt around Russia’s electronic warfare and air defence systems to reach their target. “Understanding and visualising what that looks like across the entire battle space is really critical to optimising these missions,” he says. The execution of the long-range drone strikes is being co-ordinated by Ukraine’s intelligence agencies, who work in secrecy. But the BBC has been told by other sources about some of the detail.   Scores of drones can be fired for any one mission – as many as 60 at one target. The attacks are mostly carried out at night. Most will be shot down. As few as 10% may reach the target. Some drones are even shot down along the way by friendly fire - Ukraine’s own air defences. Ukraine has had to work out ways to counter Russian electronic jamming. Terminal Autonomy’s Scythe drone uses visual positioning – navigating its course and examining the terrain by Artificial Intelligence. There is no pilot involved. Palantir software will have already mapped the best routes. Mr Serra-Martins says flying a lot of drones is key to overwhelming and exhausting Russia’s air defences.  So too is making the drones cheaper than the missiles trying to shoot them down, or the targets they are trying to hit. Prof Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute says Ukraine’s long-range drone attacks  are creating dilemmas for Moscow. Although Russia has a lot of air defences, it still cannot protect everything. Prof Bronk says Ukraine’s long-range strikes are showing ordinary Russians that “the state can’t defend them fully and that Russia is vulnerable”.  Ukrainian drones have been spotted more than 1,000km (620 miles) inside Russia. They have been shot down over Moscow.  But the focus has been on military sites. The map below highlights just a handful of the dozen targets hit over the past few months. They include five Russian airbases. Prof Justin Bronk says targeting Russian airbases has so far been the only effective way Ukraine has to respond to Russia’s glide bombs.  It has forced Russia to move aircraft to bases further away and reduce the frequency of their attacks. Satellite imagery shows how Ukrainian drones have successfully damaged hangars at its Marinovka airbase. Ukraine clearly believes it could do even more with the help of Western-made long-range weapons. But so far, allies have rejected Kyiv’s pleas.  There is still a lingering fear, especially in Washington and Berlin, that it could drag the West further into the conflict. But that hasn’t stopped Western companies and finance from helping Ukraine. Ukraine is still largely having to rely on its home-grown efforts, convinced that bringing the war to Russia is a key to winning this war. Francisco Serra-Martins also believes Western manufacturers are still “woefully unprepared” to fight high-intensity warfare – producing far fewer long-range weapons at a much higher cost. He says what Ukraine really needs now “is a lot of good enough systems”.  The BBC has talked to one Ukrainian company which is already developing a new cruise missile, at least 10 times cheaper than a British-made Storm Shadow missile.  Despite the West’s misgivings, Ukraine is planning to step up its attacks on Russia. Mr Serra-Martins says: “What you’re seeing now is like nothing compared to what you’ll see by the end of the year.\" Dawn Sturgess was inadvertently exposed to the deadly nerve agent Novichok in Amesbury in 2018.
